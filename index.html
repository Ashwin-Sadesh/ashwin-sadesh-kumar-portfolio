        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Ashwin Sadesh Kumar, a passionate and dynamic professional with a strong academic background in Physics and Applied Artificial Intelligence. My journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Physics, where I developed a profound understanding of the physical world, particularly in areas such as Astrophysics, Computational Physics, and Numerical Analysis. This foundation not only honed my analytical and problem-solving skills but also instilled a deep curiosity about the universe and the complex phenomena that govern it.</p>
        <p>As I delved deeper into the world of physics, I realized the immense potential of computational tools and machine learning in solving complex scientific problems. This led me to pursue a Postgraduate program in Applied AI, where I gained expertise in cutting-edge technologies and methodologies. I have developed strong technical proficiency in machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and ensemble methods. My deep learning expertise includes working with CNNs, ANNs, and transformer models like BERT, allowing me to tackle challenges in both structured and unstructured data.</p>
        <p>In addition to my technical skills in AI and Physics, I have acquired a diverse toolkit of software and programming languages. My proficiency in Python has been central to my success in data science and AI projects, enabling me to develop complex models and algorithms. I am skilled in data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, where I can transform raw data into meaningful insights. My knowledge extends to advanced Excel for data manipulation, Azure for cloud computing, and programming languages like HTML and Java for web development and software integration.</p>
        <p>Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have been involved in several high-impact projects that bridge the gap between physics and AI. For instance, my work on the Stellar Galaxy Classification Model utilized deep learning techniques to automate the classification of astronomical objects, contributing to advancements in astrophysical research. Similarly, my Social media sentiment analysis project combined NLP and Analytics to innovate in the retail sector, showcasing my ability to apply technical expertise to real-world problems.</p>
        <p>I am driven by a desire to explore the intersection of science and technology, using my knowledge to innovate and create solutions that push the boundaries of what’s possible. Whether it’s analyzing complex datasets, developing predictive models, or creating immersive digital experiences, I am committed to excellence and continuous learning. My ultimate goal is to build a career that leverages my dual expertise in Physics and AI to contribute meaningfully to the fields of data science, artificial intelligence, and beyond.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy stargazing, playing football, and writing stories, which allows me to stay creative and balanced. I am eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities that align with my passions and skills.</p>
